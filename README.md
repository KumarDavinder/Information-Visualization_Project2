# Information Visualization Project2

This project, to be carried out in JavaScript language, consists in exploring the various alternative heuristics for the 
removal of direct cycles of a directed graph, with the aim of reducing the number of arcs that have been inverted.
Among the heuristics that could be compared are the following:
 - Heuristics based on a deep visit
 - Greedy approach proposed by Eades et al. [1]
 - Other heuristics produced by us
